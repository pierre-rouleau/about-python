Installing Python On macOS
==========================

System Python 2.7.16 on macOS Mojave
------------------------------------

On macOS Mojave and earlier releases, Python is already installed.
It's the Apple system version of Python.  That means you can use it but you
should not modify it.  On macOS Mojave the installed system Python is Python
2.7.16.

Installing Python 3
-------------------

To install Python 3 on macOS Mojave I used Homebrew_, a popular package manager
for macOS.  You can find instructions on how to install Homebrew and Python 3
using Homebrew on the following page of `The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python`_:

- `Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X`_.

.. _Homebrew: https://docs.brew.sh/
.. _The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python: https://docs.python-guide.org/
.. _Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx
.. _Selecting a Python version for a shell: selecting-python-in-shell.rst


I set up my system in such a way that a version of Python 3 is the default,
but I can also change to another version of Python easily.
See the section `Selecting a Python version for a shell`_ for more info.
